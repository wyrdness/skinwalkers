According to Navajo belief, these are individuals who have gained dark supernatural powers through the worst kind of taboo violations, including murder of close family members. They are said to possess the ability to transform into animals - most commonly coyotes, wolves, foxes, eagles, owls, or crows - by wearing the pelts of these creatures. This is not cryptozoology or paranormal entertainment - it is a deeply serious spiritual matter within Navajo culture. Many Navajo people refuse to discuss this subject as speaking of skinwalkers is believed to attract their attention and bring misfortune. Non-Navajo investigation and tourism related to this topic is considered highly disrespectful cultural appropriation."
