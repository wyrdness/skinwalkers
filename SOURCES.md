# Sources & References

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE ON SOURCES

This topic requires careful attention to source authority and cultural respect. **Navajo voices and perspectives are the ONLY authoritative sources** on skinwalker beliefs. Non-Navajo sources must be evaluated critically for accuracy, respect, and potential appropriation.

## Media Literacy and Critical Evaluation

### Evaluating Sources

When encountering information about skinwalkers, ask:

1. **Who is speaking?** Is this a Navajo voice or an outsider?
2. **What is their relationship to Navajo culture?** Do they have permission to share this?
3. **What is the intent?** Education and respect, or entertainment and profit?
4. **Is it sensationalized?** Does it treat this as "spooky" rather than sacred?
5. **Does it center Navajo voices?** Or does it center non-Navajo "experts"?
6. **What are Navajo people saying about it?** Do they support this representation?

### Red Flags for Problematic Sources:

- ❌ Treats skinwalkers as "cryptids" or "monsters"
- ❌ Written/produced by non-Navajo without Navajo partnership
- ❌ Sensationalizes or creates "horror" content
- ❌ Commercial paranormal investigation or tourism
- ❌ Claims "evidence" or "proof" as entertainment
- ❌ Divorces topic from Navajo cultural and spiritual context
- ❌ Does not include cultural sensitivity warnings
- ❌ Encourages investigation or hunting

## Recommended Approach to Learning

### Priority Order for Research:

1. **Navajo oral tradition** (if shared appropriately with you)
2. **Contemporary Navajo scholars and authors**
3. **Indigenous anthropologists and researchers**
4. **Respectful academic treatments** (critically evaluated)
5. **Early anthropological works** (with extreme caution and supplementation)

### What NOT to prioritize:

- Commercial media and entertainment
- Non-Navajo "paranormal experts"
- Social media and viral content
- Sensationalized documentaries
- "Cryptid" databases and wikis

---

## Consultation and Partnership

### If You Are Researching This Topic:

**REQUIRED steps:**
1. Partner with or consult Navajo scholars/cultural authorities
2. Obtain proper permissions from Navajo communities
3. Follow Navajo cultural protocols
4. Recognize and respect boundaries on sacred knowledge
5. Share any products back with Navajo communities
6. Be prepared to be told "no" - respect it absolutely

**Community-Based Participatory Research** (CBPR) principles should guide any research:
- Community consent and partnership
- Shared decision-making
- Benefit to the community
- Respect for cultural sovereignty
- Long-term relationship building

---

## Final Source Guidelines

### Core Principles:

1. **Navajo voices are primary** - All others are secondary
2. **Sacred knowledge has boundaries** - Some things are not for outsiders
3. **Context is essential** - This is spiritual tradition, not entertainment
4. **Appropriation is harmful** - Recognize and oppose it
5. **Respect requires action** - Not just acknowledgment but changed behavior

### Citation Responsibilities:

When citing or referencing information about skinwalkers:

- Always acknowledge Navajo cultural origin
- Include cultural sensitivity context
- Note your own cultural position and limitations
- Distinguish between Navajo beliefs and commercial appropriation
- Link to Navajo resources and voices when possible
